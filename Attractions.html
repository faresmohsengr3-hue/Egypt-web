            <h1>Pyramids</h1>
            <p>Pyramids are ancient, monumental structures with triangular faces converging at an apex, most famously built by Egyptians as elaborate tombs for pharaohs, like the iconic Giza complex (Khufu, Khafre, Menkaure) serving as eternal homes for the afterlife, though pyramids also exist in Sudan (Nubian pyramids) and Central/South America (Mesoamerican pyramids) for religious purposes. Egyptian pyramids evolved from step-like structures (Djoser) to smooth-sided tombs, showcasing incredible engineering with millions of stone blocks and complex internal passages, remaining wonders of the ancient world.  </p>
